## 🌍 Overview
Desert Lens is a deep learning-based AI system designed to analyze satellite and drone images and classify regions as urban or desert. This aids in urban planning, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. The project was presented at the Cibirx AI Hackathon 2025 (MCBS).

## 🔍 Problem Statement
With rapid urbanization and land degradation, tracking urban expansion and desertification is crucial. Traditional methods are inefficient, making AI-driven solutions essential for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.

## 💡 Solution
We built a CNN-based classification model using:
✅ Custom CNN Model (Had overfitting issues)
✅ ResNet (Pretrained Model - Final Choice)

## 🛰️ Technologies Used

    Deep Learning (CNNs & Transfer Learning)
    TensorFlow & Keras for Model Development
    Image Data Processing & Augmentation
    Performance Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrices
    Potential Future Integrations: IoT, GIS Mapping, Blockchain, and Robotics

## 📌 Key Features & Impact

    Urbanization & Environmental Monitoring
    Disaster Management & Climate Analysis
    Sustainable Infrastructure Planning
